From Light Gun Games to FPS Esports: The Shift from Play to Performance

In the living rooms of the 1980s and early 1990s, a plastic light-gun was a badge of honour for many gamers—an essential accessory and one of the most iconic peripherals in the history of videogaming. When a player raised it and pulled the trigger at a TV screen, a direct bodily connection was established between human and game world: aim, shoot, feedback. This physical interaction closely mirrored the logic of firing a real weapon, providing a tangible immersive shooting experience. That style of interactivity became the hallmark of shooting games in that era.
However, this once-ubiquitous peripheral has all but vanished from the mainstream commercial gaming market, now residing mostly in nostalgic collections. Today when one speaks of shooting games, titles like Counter‑Strike: Global Offensive and Call of Duty dominate the public consciousness—and the primary peripherals are mouse, keyboard or gamepad, whose operation is far removed from real-gun analogies and far more abstract in precision control. It is noteworthy that the light-gun still held an immersion advantage, but it was ultimately overtaken by mouse/keyboard and controller setups—not because of purely technological inferiority, but because the logic of the games industry underwent a fundamental shift.
That turning point emerged in the mid-2000s, when light-gun and other motion-based peripherals began to fade from mainstream view. With the rise of network-connectivity, esports and standardized control interfaces, the pursuit of “realistic” game immersion gradually gave way to demands for abstract efficiency, measurable performance and esports-friendly control. Modern mainstream shooting games require millisecond-level reflexes and hand-eye coordination: shooting is no longer simply an experiential moment, but a skill to be optimized. The peripherals that once aimed for singular immersion cannot satisfy those new demands—“fun” has been supplanted by “performance”.
This exhibition uses the light-gun and its related peripherals as a lens to trace the technological evolution of interaction from the era of the Atari to the PlayStation2 era. By presenting fifteen games and controllers across different periods, we chart this shift: early games emphasised immersive enjoyment, while contemporary shooters emphasise quantifiable metrics such as K/D/A, head-shot rate and tournament wins. The objective of play has changed—from a concrete sensory experience to abstract digital fun—so we no longer play simply for experience, but for efficiency.
